I received this about 2 weeks ago and only have tried the shadow primer, and the hydrating under eye primer, I absolutely love it. It goes on so smooth and keeps my eye shadow in place, this I will definitely buy again. I also want to let you know I am 54 and I believe I have finally found a product that doesn't accentuate the wrinkles or crepeyness. I will write another review once I've tried the rest of the products.","Great Product","heideg","4","5"

Not chalky, very little fallout, good staying power. This palette is great for creating looks that are feminine, rosy, and romantic. The brownish shades at the end add great colour variety and are what I think really makes this palette great since you're not stuck with just pink shades. The two dark ones at the end make it easy to use for night time looks, and the other colours are great for every day. In my opinion, Trick only looks good with the two matte shades, so I don't really pair it with any of the other colours, making it a little limiting.

There are lots of pinks with both warm and cool tones. It transitions easily from day to night with a good mix of neutral, day time colours and dark, out on the town colours. The shades are buttery and easy to blend. There is some kick back when using them, but that's to be expected with such soft shadows. A good tip is to knock the excess off before using the shadow and make sure you do eyeshadow first so you can dust off the excess and it doesn't mess up for face makeup.

"Naked3","The long-awaited follow-up to Naked and Naked2 (two of the industry's all-time bestselling palettes), Naked3 features a dozen exclusive shades for endless Naked looks. Experiment with 12 never-before-seen (and insanely beautiful) rose-hued neutrals—from the palest, shimmery pink to a deep black matte with rosy red micro-glitter.

These neutrals will make you want to get Naked all over again. Choose from every finish imaginable: ultra-smooth mattes, gorgeous pearls and glimmering metallics. Every shade in Naked3 features UD’s Pigment Infusion System™, the proprietary blend of ingredients that gives each shade its velvety texture, rich color, serious staying power and blendability.

For easy application, the mirrored case includes a professional-quality, cruelty-free double-ended Shadow/Blending Brush.

The art-school-inspired tin case is a gorgeous rose-gold color (a subtle hint at the shades inside). Embossed on top with a big ""NAKED3"" and cool facets that beg to be touched, it's sure to inspire lots of jealous stares.

Shades included:
Strange (pale neutral pink matte-satin), Dust (pale metallic pink shimmer w/iridescent micro-glitter), Burnout (light pinky-peach satin), Limit (light dusty rose matte), Buzz (metallic rose shimmer w/silver micro-glitter), Trick (light metallic pinky-copper shimmer w/tonal micro-sparkle), Nooner (medium pinky-brown matte), Liar (medium metallic mauve shimmer), Factory (pinky-brown satin), Mugshot (metallic taupe shimmer w/slight pink shift), Darkside (deep taupe-mauve satin) and Darkheart (smoky black matte w/rosy red micro-sparkle).","Urban Decay","https://www.beautyboutique.ca/Categories/Makeup/Eyes/Eyeshadow/Naked3/p/BB_604214919006","5","4.84466019417","4.64724919094","176638683","1fd8417e-71dd-5433-a982-c9c7c4a6c7bb","beautyboutique","2017-02-16T18:15:15.000+00:00","2017-02-16T18:15:15.000+00:00","604214919006","BV_REVIEW_DISPLAY","Toronto, ON, Canada","sraujp32mu3oqfjhypem16iby","False","0","0","5","True","","0","0","0","APPROVED","2017-02-16T17:52:31.000+00:00","I own all 3 Naked palette. Until this one came out I thought the original palette would be my favorite for good. But Naked3 is glorious! the soft pinky tones are perfect to achieve youthful looks. The pigments are great. I love the matte colors for blending. I'd say the only downfall to it is that the lightest shade is matte so it doesnt add any light to the inner corner of your eye. All and all, I use it everyday!","Fantastique palette!","Osheri06","5","5"
